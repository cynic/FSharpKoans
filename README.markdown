# Functional Koans - F# #

The goal of these is to teach you functional programming in general, and F# in specific, through testing.  You can use them with Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code, or just from the command-line.

## Acknowledgements

This repo was originally forked from Chris Marinos' original [F# Koans](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans) (which was, in turn, inspired by EdgeCase's fantastic [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans)).  There isn't a lot of Chris's code left &mdash; much like [Theseus' ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus), the vast majority of the "planks" have been replaced! &mdash; but this project would probably never have begun had it not been for his work.

## Contributions

Contributions, corrections, and better ways of teaching through testing are most welcome!  And, of course, bug reports are just as welcome.  The usual way of doing these things via GitHub applies :smile:.
