# Functional Koans - F# #
We decided for the sake of learning due to differing learning styles, we each attempted koans independently helping each other out where we are stuck. After completing the koans independetly, the next step is getting together as group looking at each of our solutions and working to improve their quality thus giving the group's utmost best collectively.

Ernest built all the groups answers up since we each succeeded individually.

Ernest's Koans repo keeps returning files back to the "easy" options (like List.filter) even though he has written the function several times.

# Members

## Ernest
Folder: "../Members/Ernest/" contains Ernest's code samples (with slight errors from his pushes to slightly different branches - some files dont have the final solution).
This is on his Github Repo until we meet up and finalize our work: https://github.com/edg3/FSharpKoans

## Ronald
Ronald's individual attempt found at https://github.com/RonaldTinashe/FSharpKoans/tree/fsharp/
