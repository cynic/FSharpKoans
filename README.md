# Functional Koans - F# #
We decided for the sake of learning due to differing learning styles, we each attempted koans independently helping each other out where we are stuck. After completing the koans independetly, the next step is getting together as group looking at each of our solutions and working to improve their quality thus giving the group's utmost best collectively.
